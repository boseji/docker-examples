# Special Ubuntu Docker Image

This directory contains the `Dockerfile` needed to create a custom `Ubuntu` image.

The following scripts are also provided to help in executing the following:

  - `build.sh` This script would help to create the docker **Image**
  
  - `run.sh` This script would help to run a ephemeral container
  
  - `remove.sh` This script would help to remove the built docker **Image**

## Note

We would need a special `/work` directory to be mapped into the **VM** in case of ***Windows***
